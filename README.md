# HASLR: fast hybrid assembly of long reads

HASLR is a tool for rapid genome assembly of long sequencing reads. HASLR is a hybrid tool which means it requires long reads generated by Third Generation Sequencing technologies (such as PacBio or Oxford Nanopore) together with Next Generation Sequencing reads (such as Illumina) from the same sample. HASLR is capable of assembling large genomes on a single computing node. Our experiments show that it can assemble a CHM1 human dataset in less than 10 hours using 64 CPU threads.

## Installation

### Requirements
- GCC â‰¥ 4.8.5

  --minia-asm MINIA_ASM          type of minia assembly chosen from {contigs,unitigs} [contigs]
  -v, --version                  print version
  -h, --help                     show this help message and exit
```

### Dependencies
HASLR depends on the following tools which will be installed automatically:
- [SPOA](https://github.com/rvaser/spoa) - For consensus calling of long reads
- [Minia](https://github.com/GATB/minia) - For assembling short reads
